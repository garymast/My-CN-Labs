Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
        boolean - true/false
        byte - numbers from -128 to 127
        short - numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
        int - numbers from -2^31 to 2^31 -1
        long - numbers from -2^63 to 2^63 -1
        float - used when low precision decimals required to save memory (32bit)
        double - default choice for decimal values (64bit)
        char - stores a single character

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
        int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
        The int becomes a decimal with .0 on the end

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
        It needs to be cast using (int) double

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
        + - * / %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
        They compare two numbers and return a boolean value

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
        if ( x < y ) {
        //when true, this statement executes
        } else {
        //when false, this statement executes
        }

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
        To return a Boolean result thatâ€™s based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions.

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
        boolean b;
        b = 3 > 2 && 5 < 7; // b is true

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
        int x = 0;
        x += 10

11.) What data type is a String?
        A String is an object

12.) Are string mutable?
        No, strings are always immutable

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
        + symbol

14.) Can you cast an int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?
        Yes as long as it is valid such as "200" or "54321"
        You cannot cast "fred" to an int
        int can always be cast String

15.) What is an array?
        An array is a collection of variables of the same type.

16.) What is the first index of an array?
        0

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?
        No. One would have to copy the data to a new array of a different size.

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?
        System.out.print(exampleArray[4]);

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.
        int[] arrOne = {1,2,3,4,5};

        int[] arrTwo = new int[5];
        arrTwo[0] = 1;
        arrTwo[1] = 2;
        arrTwo[2] = 3;
        arrTwo[3] = 4;
        arrTwo[4] = 5;

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?
        Using a nested for loop.

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
        The for-each loop is used to iterate through every variable in an array regardless of the size.
