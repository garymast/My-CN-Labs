2.) Why do we use git and Github?
        We use git and GitHub so that;
        Our code is backed up in a cloud repository
        So we can collaborate with co-workers
        We can track all changes made to ours/co-workers code

3.) What is the general flow of git?
        A local git repository is created on the desktop
        A gitHub repository is created which will eventually be synced with the local repository
        Files created in the local repository are
            added to the git repo
            commited for upload to github
            pushed to the github repository with changes tracked

        Files can also be pulled from the GitHub repository
            This could be someone elses work which you need to work on or it could be to create a branch of the master file

4.) What is the purpose of adding a remote to a local git repository?
        So that files can be pushed and pulled as necessary from an online repo

5.) How do you print a message to the console?
        System.out.println("message")
        sout

6.) Where does a program begin its execution?
        public static void main(String[] args){

7.) What is a code block and how do you create one?
        A code block is a block or group of statements that are required to be executed together.
        It is created by putting an opening curly brace at the beginning and a closing curly brace at the
        end a the group of statements.

8.) What is the idea of variable scope?
        Variables defined inside a set of curly braces/ code block are not visible to code which has been defined outside
        of that code block.
        For example, if some variables are defined inside a method in the class, these variables cannot be accessed by
        other methods even though they are part of the same class.

9.) What are semicolons used for?
        A semicolon ends a statement in java

10.) What are lines of code indented? When should a line be indented?
        Lines of code are indented so that the code is readable and conforms to standards.
        A line should be indented one level after an opening curly brace and move back out one level after a closing brace.

11.) What does a .java file need to be complied to a .class file before running?
        Because the JVM can only read bytecode which it then translates into machine code
