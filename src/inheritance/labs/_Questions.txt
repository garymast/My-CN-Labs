Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
        Inheritence is extending a class so that the subclass below has access to certain methods and variables in the class.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
        We use inheritence so that we are not repeating code for similar yet slighlty different classes which all retain properties of the super class.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
        In modelling a motorcycle and a car. The Motorcycle and car classes would extend the Vehicle class which would hold typical variables and methods associated with all vehicles.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
        This si done using the extends keyword.

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
        There is no limit to the number of levels.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
        The super keyword is used to specifically refer to either a method or a variable in the parent class.
        It is for the most part opposite to the this keyword.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
        The object at the top of the heirarchy is created first and then each subsequent subclass is executed in order.

8.) What is method overwriting?
        Method overwriting is the overwriting of a method that is already in the parent class.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
        This is useful when a method required to perform a task in a subclass is different from the parent method such as
        with the above motorbike and car, they do not start the same so the vehicle method for start would be overwritten by
        the motorbike class.
